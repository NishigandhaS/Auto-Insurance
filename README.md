# Auto-Insurance
Predict Customer Lifetime Value and identify Upselling options for customers whose policy is expiring.

The project is an in depth study of consumer profile for an Auto Insurance company in USA. There are many types of customers – Employed/ Unemployed, Genders, Suburban/Urban/ Rural, etc. and they opt for certain offers which are suitable to their profile. The report studies these variables in detail and develops a model to predict the Customer’s Lifetime Value.
The customer’s lifetime value is essential for a company to predict the expected revenues, allocate budgets to marketing/ expanding & sales techniques to be used to in the upcoming year. The most important aspect is to predict the most accurate CLV and retain the customers. The business may see a cascading effect if the CLV is predicted high or low than the actual value.
In a study like this, the accuracy of the model is the key. This accuracy is based on features like Customer Income, Monthly Premium, Total Claim Amount, Type of coverage, Employment Status, Education, etc. In addition to this the customer’s loyalty also contributes positively to the CLV prediction model; however the Total Claim amount & the Number of complaints by the customers will have a negative effect.
The consumer’s whose policy is expiring soon, with the help of these models and study we expect to recommend better products to the customers. Also which customers should be approached for which types offers will help the company to pitch better products generating higher revenues.
To give a more holistic view of the Auto Insurance industry, studies have been reviewed and the future of Auto Insurance with respect to ML and AI had been considered. This will help in recommending new products to the company for their future.
